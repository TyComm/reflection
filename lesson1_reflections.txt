How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that
was introduced?

    Very quick and easy.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more
efficient programmer in the long term?

    Can learn from the past experience and mistakes.

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    Sometimies when in the 'zone', people forget to save or commit, so automatic commit 
	is a good idea in that case. On the other hand, when working with other people,
	for efficiency, being able to manually commit is better.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    Commiting multiple files are useful when they're logically grouped changes.

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    I can use git log to see the overall history while use git diff to see individual changes.

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
could break something?

    I can experiment as I like because I can always go back to the previous version.

Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?

    I can use it for my first Android app development.
